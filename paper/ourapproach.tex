\section{Our Approach}

Having demonstrated the feasibility of replacing transmitted bits with
received bits and the subsequent potential for power savings, we went
on to validate this technique with an implementation.\\

Our approach was that of Gagie, starting with the server's
transmission of the probability distribution for the symbols in our
alphabet (in this case, all possible 8-bit symbols).  The server
updates this distribution after each transmission in order to provide
up-to-date information to the client.\\

We chose range encoding as our entropic compression algorithm, rather
than Huffman Coding as Gagie suggested.  Range encoding produces a
single codeword of output, allowing it to represent symbols using
fractional bits (sharing the remainder with subsequent code words),
and therefore more closely approach H(D).\\

After recieving the distribution, the client uses it to apply a
dynamic range encoding, updating the distribution after each symbol is
encoded. The client then sends the encoded message to the server.  The
server, while decoding the message, must update the distribution in
the same manner as the client in order to properly decode the message,
and in doing so also updates the distribution to reflect the received
message.\\
